"""Focus sessions — persisted Pomodoro / Stopwatch records (premium Focus view).

The Focus page timer is front-end JS; when a Pomodoro completes (or the user ends
a stopwatch span) the browser POSTs the finished session here so the Overview
stats (Today's/Total Pomo + Focus duration) and the Focus Record list stop being
static 0s. A session is one finished span of focused time; `mode='pomo'` rows
also count as one Pomodoro. Stats are READ-ONLY derived (sec14): we sum rows, we
never recompute them elsewhere. Each write appends its event (sec14.1) in one txn.
