"""Lesson attempt recording — the D4 backend of docs/learn-bundle-spec.md §6.

Authority and projection (§6.1): the `lesson_attempts` SQLite table is the
authority; each row is written in ONE transaction with its `lesson_attempt`
ledger event. `attempts.jsonl` at the bundle root is a synchronous, app-owned
projection so the study agent reads attempts as a plain file — it may lag or
be lost, and an idempotent reconcile pass rebuilds it from SQLite. A
projection failure never fails the authoritative write; the response
distinguishes recorded+projected / recorded+projection-pending / duplicate,
with `stale` as a flag on the record (§6.3 — late data is never dropped).

Trust model (D2 review gate, lesson-bridge-abi.md §4): possession of a bridge
port is NOT authority. Every write here re-validates against the record-time
manifest — the question must be declared (§4.3/§6.4), the lesson uid comes
from the DB row (never the client), and `stale` is derived server-side by
comparing the submitted load-time identity against the current binding and
the current page bytes on disk. The client supplies only: question_id,
page_id, page_rev (what it saw at load time), answer, idempotency_key.

No auto-agents: recording an attempt writes the row, the event, and the
projection line — it never wakes or notifies an agent (Check v1 is
save-only; a future agent subscribes to `lesson_attempt` events instead).
