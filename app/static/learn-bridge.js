/* Learn preview runtime + lesson bridge parent (D2, ABI v1 — see
 * docs/lesson-bridge-abi.md).
 *
 * Owns the whole preview-frame lifecycle on /learn, because the bridge grant
 * must be BOUND to the loaded revision (spec §5/D1): the same code that
 * decides what document the iframe shows is the code that decides which
 * identity a handshake may carry. Replaces the meta-poll block that lived in
 * app.js.
 *
 * Trust model: the iframe document is untrusted lesson content in an
 * opaque-origin sandbox. The parent owns lesson_uid/page_id/page_rev and the
 * capability set; the child supplies none of them (it only announces itself
 * and asks). Messages TO the child go with targetOrigin "*" — an opaque
 * origin is not addressable — which is safe here because we post only to the
 * specific contentWindow we navigated, the payload holds page identity (no
 * secrets), and the capability channel is the transferred MessagePort, held
 * by whoever received it, not by whoever can read a broadcast. Messages FROM
 * the child are accepted only when `event.source === frame.contentWindow`.
 *
 * D5 adds the one write capability, `attempts`: the child asks (`want`),
 * and when this runtime can reach the attempt endpoint the welcome grants
 * it. The child supplies ONLY {v, op, request_id, question_id, answer}; the
 * parent derives page identity from its own armed binding, re-validates it
 * against fresh preview metadata per operation (D2 review gate: possession
 * of the port is never authority — and neither is having been armed once),
 * refuses questions the manifest does not declare for the armed page, and
 * owns idempotency by mapping the child's request_id onto the endpoint's
 * idempotency_key. Confirmation is an app toast; the lesson document only
 * gets the structured result. */
