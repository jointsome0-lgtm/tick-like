"""Central request-security perimeter for the main app (issue #15, minimal slice).

One ASGI middleware, installed once in main.py, owns three jobs that used to be
per-route (or absent):

1. Trusted-host allowlist. Every HTTP request and WebSocket handshake must
   carry a Host whose hostname is in EPHEMERIS_TRUSTED_HOSTS (comma-separated;
   default: the loopback names). Blocks DNS rebinding for the whole app, GET
   routes included. Starlette's TrustedHostMiddleware is not used because it
   splits Host on ":" and so mangles bracketed IPv6 ("[::1]:8765" -> "[");
   we parse like app/terminal.py does, with urlsplit.

2. Write guard. Every unsafe-method request (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE — anything
   a new route could add) passes one origin policy; a route cannot opt out by
   forgetting a call. Load-bearing invariant: safe methods are NOT guarded,
   so GET/HEAD routes must stay side-effect-free — a mutating GET would sit
   outside this policy. The policy, each case deliberate:
   - Origin present: every value (getlist — duplicates can't smuggle) must be
     a serialized http(s) origin (no userinfo/path/query/fragment) equal to
     the request's own (scheme, hostname, port) — scheme from the ASGI scope,
     hostname/port from Host, default ports normalized so "http://host" and
     "http://host:80" are the same origin. Cross-anything, including a scheme
     mismatch (https page writing to the http app), -> 403.
   - "Origin: null" -> 403. An opaque origin is what the sandboxed lesson
     iframe would send on a direct form POST; the sanctioned write path for
     lesson content is the postMessage bridge (issue #36), never a direct POST.
   - Origin absent, no Sec-Fetch-Site: allowed. This is the non-browser
     loopback client (curl, agent CLI, TestClient); browsers always send
     Origin on cross-origin unsafe requests, so CSRF stays covered.
   - Origin absent but Sec-Fetch-Site present and neither "same-origin" nor
     "none": 403. Defense in depth against a browser path that omits Origin;
     "same-site" is deliberately rejected — a page on another local port is
     same-site but must not write here (same stance as the terminal gate F1).

3. Response headers on every HTTP response:
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Referrer-Policy: same-origin
   - Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none' — only when the route
     set no CSP of its own, so the lesson-preview responses keep their full
     sandbox CSP with the narrow frame-ancestors 'self' exception.

The middleware never *accepts* a WebSocket — a bad handshake Host is refused
pre-accept (close code 1008; HTTP requests get a 400) before the app sees
it; everything else passes through to the terminal gate in app/terminal.py,
which stays the stricter authority (loopback peer + loopback Host +
exact-origin).
