# Learn bundle contract — `lesson.json` schema v1/v2, attempts, artifacts

Frozen by [#39](https://github.com/jointsome0-lgtm/ephemeris/issues/39)
(session C1, 2026-07-16). This document is the single schema owner for the
lesson bundle: field names, identity, limits, compatibility, and discovery
rules that were previously scattered across #1, #35, #36, and #38.

Consumers, in dependency order:

- the Learn UI and preview (`app/services/lessons.py` — implements the v1
  subset today; v2 readers land in C3);
- the study agent, via the generated `AGENTS.md` teaching contract (#35);
- the attempt surfaces: postMessage bridge (D2), attempt backend (D4),
  editor/runner (F1–F5);
- deterministic external adapters owned by Selfos
  ([selfos#26](https://github.com/jointsome0-lgtm/selfos/issues/26)), per the
  integration decision in
  [selfos#25](https://github.com/jointsome0-lgtm/selfos/issues/25).

Conformance language: MUST/MUST NOT are contract; SHOULD is a default a
conforming writer follows unless it documents why not. Until C3 lands, the
running code implements only the v1 subset; this document still governs what
C3+ is allowed to build.

## 1. Boundary rules (non-negotiable)

- The manifest is the machine-readable index; HTML pages remain presentation.
  A conforming consumer never parses lesson HTML to discover structure.
- Everything in a bundle is a plain file under the bundle directory. No
  bespoke API, no hidden database.
- Atlas-facing values (`path`, `concepts`) are **opaque references**. No
  Ephemeris validation reads Atlas files, calls an Atlas URL, or imports
  Atlas code. Unknown refs are valid Ephemeris data; resolution findings
  belong to the adapter/Atlas side.
- A bundle remains fully usable when no Atlas or Selfos integration is
  configured.
- `studied` and the other lesson statuses are Ephemeris lifecycle values,
  never an Atlas confidence/mastery assertion.
- Bundles may contain private study content. Fixtures and docs use invented
  demo data only (see `fixtures/lesson-manifests/`, marked "Vera Example").

## 2. Bundle layout and reserved names

```
data/lessons/<slug>/
  lesson.json      manifest (this contract)
  index.html       conventional entry page
  related/         further pages, one self-contained HTML file per stage
  assets/          images/data referenced by pages (relative paths)
  attempts/        learner-authored work (default artifact root)
  attempts.jsonl   app-owned projection of recorded attempts (§6)
  AGENTS.md        app-generated agent brief — regenerated, never authored
  CLAUDE.md        app-generated shim for AGENTS.md — regenerated
```

Reserved names, which no page, block file, or artifact root may claim:
`lesson.json`, `attempts.jsonl`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

Symlink policy (whole bundle, all consumers): symlinks are never followed —
not for the bundle directory itself, not for any file inside it. A path that
resolves through a symlink is treated as missing/invalid. This is a NEW,
stricter rule than today's code: `_bundle_path` resolves and only checks
containment (an in-bundle symlink to an in-bundle target is followed), and
the read path never calls `_bundle_dir_is_safe`. C3 MUST implement
per-segment enforcement (`lstat`/`O_NOFOLLOW` per component, or a
realpath-within-root check that additionally rejects any symlink component)
rather than reusing `resolve()`+containment.

Reader mapping: a manifest-referenced path (entry, page, block `file`,
artifact root) that exists but resolves through a symlink is treated as a
missing file with a `symlinked-path` finding (degraded — for pages this
means the "no HTML yet" placeholder, not a drop from `pages[]`); the bundle
directory itself — or `lesson.json` itself — being a symlink rejects the
bundle with its own code, `symlinked-bundle` (rejected), so the §9.2
severity aggregation needs no special case. A symlinked manifest is a
bundle-integrity failure, never "missing" (no default-skeleton creation —
that would mask a planted link). Artifact enumeration skips symlinks with
`symlinked-path`.

## 3. Identity model

Five identifiers, five owners:

| id            | minted by                    | lives in                        | stable across                                   |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `lesson_uid`  | Ephemeris service (SQLite)   | `lessons.uid` column, manifest echo | title/slug/rename, path membership, page edits, page order |
| `page_id`     | manifest author (agent/app/migration) | `pages[].id`             | content edits, file rename, reorder             |
| `question_id` | manifest author              | `questions[].id`                | page edits that keep the question's meaning     |
| `block_id`    | manifest author              | `blocks[].id`                   | content edits, file path changes                |
| `attempt_id`  | attempt backend (SQLite, D4) | `lesson_attempts` row, projection record | forever (immutable once written)          |

Formats:

- `lesson_uid`, `attempt_id`: RFC 4122 UUID string, validated by shape only:
  `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`
  (lowercase hex; version/variant nibbles are not checked — same family as
  `events.uuid` from #17/B4).
- `page_id`, `question_id`, `block_id`: the prefix is type-bound —
  `pages[].id` matches `^pg_[a-z0-9]{4,32}$`, `questions[].id`
  `^q_[a-z0-9]{4,32}$`, `blocks[].id` `^blk_[a-z0-9]{4,32}$`; an id with
  the wrong prefix for its position violates the grammar (`invalid-id`).
  The suffix carries no meaning; it MUST NOT be derived from the title and
  MUST NOT be re-derived when the underlying file is renamed.

Authority: the SQLite `lessons` table (column `uid`, added in C3) is the mint
source and the truth for `lesson_uid`; after the C3 backfill the column is
`NOT NULL UNIQUE`, minted exactly once per lesson — rerunning the DB
migration or the C4 tool NEVER replaces an existing uid (the `events.uuid`
backfill idiom from B4). The manifest carries an echo so a
bundle is self-describing for the agent and adapters. On mismatch the DB
wins, the reader reports `identity-mismatch`, and attempt writes are refused
until the mismatch is resolved explicitly (re-keying is a migration-tool
concern, not a read-path side effect).

### 3.1 ID lifecycle across page edits

- **Editing page content** keeps `page_id` and path. Revision is carried by
  `page_rev` (§6.3), not by identity.
- **Renaming a page file** keeps `page_id`; the same manifest edit updates
  `pages[].path`.
- **Reordering `pages[]`** changes presentation order only; ids untouched.
- **Deleting a page** removes its entry and retires the id forever — a
  retired id MUST NOT be reused for new content. Historical attempts keep
  referencing it; adapters treat ids as durable keys. Non-reuse is an
  authoring rule (the #35 agent contract carries it), not a reader duty:
  nothing in the bundle persists the retired set, and readers cannot detect
  a meaning change mechanically. The durable record is the attempts side
  (`lesson_attempts` rows and their ledger events) — ids referenced there
  but absent from the manifest are retired, and C3 MAY use that as an
  advisory collision check.
- **Splitting a page**: the original keeps its id; new pages mint new ids. A
  question moves with its id only while it remains the same question; if the
  question's meaning changes, mint a new `question_id` and retire the old.
- The same rules apply to `block_id` (a block's `file` may move between
  artifact-root locations without changing identity).

## 4. Manifest schema v2

Top-level fields, in canonical writer order:

| field                 | req | type / limits |
|-----------------------|-----|---------------|
| `schema_version`      | yes | integer `2` |
| `lesson_uid`          | yes | UUID string (§3) |
| `slug`                | yes | copy of DB slug, `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, ≤ 80 |
| `title`               | yes | copy of DB title, ≤ 240 |
| `source_url`          | no  | http(s) URL ≤ 1000, or `null` (treated as absent) |
| `entry`               | yes | bundle path (§4.1) of the default page; MUST equal some `pages[].path` |
| `pages`               | yes | ordered list, 1–200 items (§4.2) |
| `questions`           | no  | list, ≤ 200 items (§4.3) |
| `blocks`              | no  | list, ≤ 100 items (§4.4) |
| `path`                | no  | opaque learning-path ref (§4.5) |
| `step`                | no  | integer 1–10000; present only when `path` is present |
| `concepts`            | no  | ordered list of opaque refs, ≤ 64 items (§4.5) |
| `runtime`             | no  | `{"profile": …}` (§5); missing ⇒ `legacy-display` |
| `artifact_roots`      | no  | list of bundle dir paths, ≤ 8 (§7); missing ⇒ `["attempts"]` |
| `updated_by_agent_at` | no  | ISO-8601 timestamp, set by the agent on page/manifest edits |

`slug` and `title` are non-authoritative conveniences (the DB row is the
truth); a mismatch — including one of these copies violating its own
grammar or length limit — is an informational `stale-metadata` finding and
the DB value wins for display. Unknown fields at any level are ignored by
readers and MUST be preserved by writers (§9.3).

The "req" column binds **writers**: a conforming writer always emits those
fields. Readers do not necessarily reject on violation — reader recovery is
defined per finding in §9.2 (e.g. a bad `entry` degrades with a fallback
rather than rejecting).

Type mismatches: a field whose JSON type contradicts this section is
treated as ABSENT (then the field's absent-rule applies) with a
`type-mismatch` finding (degraded) — e.g. a non-list `pages` is absent
pages (also `no-pages`, rejected), a non-object `runtime` falls to
`legacy-display`, a non-string `entry` falls back (also `invalid-entry`). A
non-object item inside `pages[]`/`questions[]`/`blocks[]` is dropped
(`type-mismatch`); `runtime.profile` missing or non-string is handled as
`unknown-profile`. A malformed `updated_by_agent_at` string is treated as
absent (`invalid-value`, info).

### 4.1 Path grammar

Applies to `entry`, `pages[].path`, `blocks[].file`, `artifact_roots[]`:

- bundle-relative POSIX path, 1–200 characters;
- no backslash, no control characters (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F);
- not absolute, no `.` or `..` segments, no empty segments (`//`), no
  trailing slash;
- equal to its own whitespace-stripped form: leading or trailing whitespace
  (anything `str.strip()` removes) is invalid, not repaired — the app's
  request-cleaning layer strips it, so such a path could never be resolved
  or served verbatim (C3 review addition);
- must not be, or be nested under, a reserved name (§2) — "nested under" is
  segment-wise (`attempts.jsonl/x` is nested, `attempts.jsonl-notes` is
  not);
- `entry` and `pages[].path` must end in `.html`.

Paths are compared exactly (case-sensitive); authors SHOULD stay lowercase
kebab-case. The `related/NN-topic.html` naming is the #35 teaching-contract
convention, not a schema rule.

### 4.2 `pages[]`

`{"id": "pg_…", "path": "related/01-….html", "title": "…"?}`

- `id`: required, §3 grammar, unique within the manifest;
- `path`: required, §4.1 grammar, unique within the manifest;
- `title`: optional display label ≤ 240 (tabs/adapters; not identity).

`pages[]` lists **every** page, entry included, in reading order. Reading
order is the list order — there is no separate ordering field. For v2
bundles the app's page-selection writes (`mark_opened`, `set_current_entry`)
accept only declared `pages[].path`; v1's tolerance of selecting undeclared
pages (and injecting them into the displayed list) does not carry into v2 —
a stored selection absent from `pages[]` falls back to `entry` with an
`invalid-entry` finding.

### 4.3 `questions[]`

`{"id": "q_…", "page": "pg_…", "kind": "prediction"?, "label": "…"?}`

- `id`: required, unique; the durable key attempts reference;
- `page`: required, must reference an existing `pages[].id`;
- `kind`: optional, `^[a-z0-9_-]{1,40}$`; readers treat unknown but
  grammar-valid kinds as `free_text`; a kind violating the grammar is
  dropped (`invalid-value`, the question stays with the default kind);
  recommended values: `prediction`, `free_text`, `self_check`;
- `label`: optional adapter-facing summary ≤ 200. The full prompt lives in
  the page HTML; the manifest only declares existence and identity.

A question that is not declared here does not exist: the attempt backend
rejects writes for undeclared `question_id`s (D4/D5).

### 4.4 `blocks[]` — editor/run blocks

`{"id": "blk_…", "page": "pg_…", "kind": "editor", "language": "python"?,
"file": "attempts/blk_…/main.py", "runner_id": "python-script-v1"?}`

- `id`: required, unique; `page`: required, must resolve;
- `kind`: required; v2 defines only `editor`. An unknown kind drops the
  block from the read model (`unknown-kind`, degraded), the bundle still
  renders;
- `language`: optional editor hint, `^[a-z0-9+.-]{1,40}$`;
- `file`: required, §4.1 grammar, MUST be under an artifact root (§7),
  unique across blocks — this is the only place the app learns where a
  block's artifact lives (F1 saves resolve paths from the manifest, never
  from client input);
- `runner_id`: optional, `^[a-z0-9-]{1,64}$`. **The manifest never contains
  commands, arguments, env vars, or shell text.** A `runner_id` is an opaque
  key into a registry of fixed command templates compiled into the app
  (F3). Absent ⇒ save-only editor, no Run affordance. Unknown but
  grammar-valid ⇒ Run disabled with a visible `unknown-runner` finding; the
  editor still works. Violating the grammar ⇒ the field is dropped
  (`invalid-value`), leaving the same save-only editor as absent.

### 4.5 Opaque refs: `path`, `step`, `concepts`

- A ref is a string of 1–200 characters, no control characters. It is an
  atom: never resolved locally, never validated against Atlas, never used in
  a filesystem operation, never interpreted as a URL.
- `path` + `step` place the lesson on one learning path; `step` without
  `path`, a non-integer `step`, or a `step` outside 1–10000 is dropped
  (`invalid-ref`; `path` alone stays valid).
- `concepts` is ordered and deduplicated by exact string match; duplicates
  are deduped (first occurrence wins) with an informational
  `duplicate-concept` finding.
- There is no canonical local vocabulary file: ontology, drift, and merge
  belong to Atlas (selfos#25). Agents SHOULD reuse refs already present in
  the bundle's own history before inventing near-synonyms (#35 wording).

## 5. Runtime profiles

`runtime.profile` selects between **app-defined** policy sets; the manifest
can only pick a registered profile, never compose or widen policy (no CSP
fragments, no capability lists in the manifest).

| profile                | rendering | bridge | attempts | editor/run blocks |
|------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| `legacy-display`       | sandboxed iframe as today | no | no | inert (visible in preview meta) |
| `interactive-local-v1` | sandboxed iframe + strict CSP (D1: `connect-src 'none'`, no remote scripts, no eval, no forms/popups/downloads) | eligible when the manifest is valid v2 (D2) | via bridge for declared questions (D4/D5) | active as features land (F phases) |

- Missing `runtime` ⇒ `legacy-display` (fail-closed default).
- Unknown profile ⇒ forced `legacy-display` + `unknown-profile` finding.
  Fail-closed means: never grant bridge, attempts, or run affordances under
  an unrecognized profile.
- v1 manifests are always `legacy-display`; there is no way to opt a v1
  manifest into interactivity.
- The preview metadata surfaces the effective profile (D1) and any findings.

D1 (landed) pins the enforcement:

- Two header-level CSPs live in the app, keyed by the effective profile from
  the manifest read; the manifest never carries CSP fragments (§5 intro).
- `legacy-display` keeps the historical permissive policy verbatim (remote
  `https:`, `'unsafe-eval'`, forms/popups/downloads) so pre-v2 bundles render
  unchanged. The profile still grants no bridge/attempt/editor/run
  affordances — those flags come from the manifest read, not the CSP.
- `interactive-local-v1` is local-only: `sandbox allow-scripts`;
  `default-src 'none'`; `script-src`/`style-src` `'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
  (pages are self-contained, pinned libraries under `assets/` are
  same-origin); `img-src`/`media-src` `'self' data: blob:`;
  `font-src 'self' data:`; `connect-src 'none'` (the D2 bridge is
  postMessage, not fetch); `webrtc 'block'` (WebRTC is not governed by
  `connect-src`; the CSP3 directive closes the RTCPeerConnection/STUN
  channel where enforced — Firefox today, Chromium ignores it and keeps
  WebRTC in the residual below); `form-action`/`object-src`/`base-uri`
  `'none'`; `frame-ancestors 'self'`. No remote loads, no eval vectors (no
  `'unsafe-eval'`, no `data:`/`blob:` script), no nested frames.
- Bridge eligibility = manifest parsed as v2 AND not rejected AND profile
  `interactive-local-v1`. Degraded v2 findings do not revoke it (identity
  stays valid; D2 gates per page); every fail-closed-to-legacy path does.
- The preview metadata carries the effective `profile` and `bridge`; the
  iframe `sandbox` attribute is unchanged until D2 (the header-level
  `sandbox` directive also covers a page opened outside the iframe).
- An existing page's live-reload version token folds the effective profile
  in, so a manifest-only profile flip (either direction) reloads the open
  document: the metadata never advertises a policy the displayed document
  was not actually served under. D2 additionally binds bridge setup to the
  loaded revision, not to a later uncorrelated metadata read.
- An unregistered profile value reaching the CSP chooser (unreachable via
  the readers) selects the narrow interactive policy, never the wide one.
- Known residual: same-frame navigation (script `location` assignment, a
  plain link, meta refresh) is not blocked — the navigated-to document is
  outside the lesson response's CSP. No shipped mechanism closes this:
  CSP3's `navigate-to` was removed from the spec (Sept 2022) without any
  browser implementation, and no iframe sandbox token governs a frame
  navigating itself. Every in-document channel (fetch/beacon/WebSocket,
  forms, popups, downloads, remote subresources; WebRTC on engines that
  enforce `webrtc 'block'`) IS closed, so on those engines the channel
  requires a whole-document navigation the learner can see; on engines
  without the `webrtc` directive (Chromium today) WebRTC joins this
  residual. Accepted for
  the loopback single-user deployment; D2's parent runtime — whose bridge
  port dies with the document — is the layer that observes a frame leaving
  the lesson and can tear it down/reload it.

New app-created bundles start as `interactive-local-v1`; migrated v1 bundles
start as `legacy-display` and are upgraded deliberately (§10, §12).
Concretely, post-C3 `create_lesson` writes a **v2** skeleton (replacing
today's v1 `_default_manifest`): `schema_version` 2, the DB-minted
`lesson_uid`, `slug`/`title` copies, `source_url` only when the lesson has
one (absent optionals are omitted, §9.3 — never `null` as today's v1
default writes), `entry` `index.html`,
`pages` with one minted id for `index.html`, `runtime`
`{"profile": "interactive-local-v1"}`, `artifact_roots` `["attempts"]`.

## 6. Attempts

### 6.1 Authority and projection

- **Authority**: the `lesson_attempts` SQLite table (D4). Each attempt row
  and its `lesson_attempt` ledger event are written in ONE transaction (the
  repo's standard write idiom; event identity via `events.uuid` from B4).
- **Projection**: `attempts.jsonl` at the bundle root — written by the app
  so the study agent reads attempts as a plain file, never touching the DB.
  The projection may lag or be lost; a reconcile pass rebuilds it from
  SQLite idempotently (dedupe by `attempt_id`, ascending `created_at`, ties
  by `attempt_id`; the pass may atomically rewrite the whole file).
- The projection is app-owned and read-only for everyone else. A projection
  failure never fails the authoritative write; the attempt response
  distinguishes durable+projected / durable+projection-pending / duplicate /
  stale-revision (D4).
- The manifest does NOT list attempts. Their canonical locations are fixed:
  the table, the projection file, and learner files under artifact roots.

### 6.2 Projection record format (`attempts.jsonl`, one JSON object per line)

```json
{"kind": "attempt", "v": 1,
 "attempt_id": "0d3f2b9a-6e4c-4f7d-8a1b-5c9e7d2f4a60",
 "event_uuid": "9c1e5a7b-3d2f-4b8e-9f4a-1b6d8c0e2a53",
 "lesson_uid": "7f2a4c88-9d3b-4e21-8b5a-6c0d1e9f3a72",
 "page_id": "pg_3f8ba65c12", "question_id": "q_5a1c380f6e",
 "page_rev": "sha256:…64 lowercase hex…",
 "answer": "Vera Example: I predict the largest value reaches the end.",
 "created_at": "2026-07-16T12:00:00+00:00", "stale": false}
```

- `v` versions the record shape; unknown record versions and malformed
  lines are skipped by readers, never a crash. These are out-of-band
  conditions (reconcile reporting, adapter-side findings), NOT §9.2
  manifest findings — the preview finding contract is manifest-scoped, and
  the reconcile pass repairs the projection from the authority anyway;
- `answer` is free text, ≤ 32 KiB UTF-8; whole line ≤ 64 KiB;
- `created_at` is UTC ISO-8601.

### 6.3 Idempotency and content revision

- Idempotency key: an opaque client token ≤ 128 chars, unique per lesson,
  stored with the attempt row. Replaying a submission with a known key
  whose stored (`question_id`, `page_id`) match the incoming submission
  returns the original `attempt_id` and writes nothing; a known key with a
  DIFFERENT question/page is a client bug and gets a distinct
  idempotency-conflict rejection — it is never silently coalesced into the
  earlier attempt. The bridge's `request_id` (D2/D5) maps onto the key; the
  parent page owns the mapping — the iframe never supplies identity
  (lesson/page ids) directly.
- `page_rev` = `"sha256:" + hex` over the page file's **raw bytes on disk**
  at the time the parent loaded the page (parent-derived, D2). Both sides
  hash the same raw byte stream; display-side decoding (e.g. the preview's
  `errors="replace"` read) plays no part in hashing. If the current file
  hash differs at record time, the attempt is still recorded, flagged
  `stale: true` — learning data is never dropped for being late.

### 6.4 Attempt validity across lifecycle changes

Validity is always checked against the **record-time** manifest; load-time
identity travels in the submission only for staleness comparison. The line
between the two rules — "reject undeclared questions" (§4.3) and "never
drop late data" (§6.3) — is identity vs revision: a question that still
EXISTS is recorded however stale; identity that no longer exists is
rejected with a distinct response.

| state at record time | result |
|---|---|
| question declared; binding and page bytes unchanged | recorded, `stale: false` |
| question declared; page bytes differ (edit or rename) | recorded, `stale: true` |
| question declared but now bound to a different page than submitted | recorded under the **submitted** page identity, `stale: true` — the stored `page_id` stays paired with the `page_rev` the learner actually saw, and an idempotent replay of the same submission still matches (§6.3); the current binding is derivable from the manifest via `question_id` |
| question not declared (removed, retired, or meaning-changed → new id) | rejected — distinct unknown-question response (D4), nothing written |
| page file missing or unreadable at record time | recorded, `stale: true` (current revision unknowable — conservative flag) |

## 7. Artifact roots and deterministic discovery

`artifact_roots` (default `["attempts"]`) bounds where learner-authored work
lives. Rules:

- each root follows §4.1, is a directory path, and MUST NOT be (or nest
  under) a reserved name; roots MUST be disjoint — segment-wise: no root is
  a path-segment prefix of another (`attempts` vs `attempts/deep` overlap;
  `attempts` vs `attempts-extra` do not). A nested root is dropped with an
  `overlapping-roots` finding (degraded). A root also MUST NOT be, or nest
  under, `assets` — the presentation area pages reference (§2); such a root
  is dropped the same way (C3 review addition: otherwise the preview file
  surface and artifact discovery would claim the same files);
- the list MUST always include `attempts` (writers); a manifest missing it
  gets `attempts` injected into the read model with a
  `missing-attempts-root` finding (informational);
- every `blocks[].file` MUST fall under some artifact root (`outside-root`
  finding otherwise; the block is dropped from the read model);
- adapters and the app enumerate learner work ONLY inside artifact roots.

Deterministic adapter enumeration (no HTML parsing, no Atlas access):

1. read `lesson.json` (reject > 256 KiB), apply the version policy (§9);
2. identity = `lesson_uid` — a **v2** contract: a v1 (or missing-version)
   bundle carries no identity, and an external adapter treats it as
   legacy-awaiting-migration — it MAY enumerate pages but MUST NOT mint or
   derive a durable identity from slug/title (in-app readers, which have
   the DB, join `lessons.uid` by slug instead);
   pages/questions/blocks from the manifest;
3. `path`/`step`/`concepts` passed through verbatim as opaque values;
4. attempts from `attempts.jsonl` if present (per §6.2 tolerance);
5. learner files: walk each artifact root lexicographically, depth ≤ 4,
   at most 512 entries per root, regular files only, symlinks skipped
   (`symlinked-path` finding); files > 2 MiB are listed but not read.

The enumeration bounds ARE the discovery contract: files beyond them may
exist on disk but are not promised to adapters — the #35 agent contract
tells the agent and learner to keep discoverable work within them. And v2
deliberately does not type non-block artifacts (code vs notes vs data): the
contract gives location and bounds, block descriptors are the only typed
artifacts, and any richer classification is the consumer's concern (an
additive v2 field later if ever needed).

## 8. Ledger event echo policy

- All `lesson_*` events written after C3 include `lesson_uid` (alongside the
  existing `lesson_id` and, where already present, `slug`). History is never
  rewritten; pre-C3 events stay as-is, and a consumer needing identity for
  them joins on `lesson_id` against the local DB.
- `lesson_attempt` (D4) event payload: `lesson_uid`, `lesson_id`, `slug`,
  `attempt_id`, `page_id`, `question_id`, `page_rev`, `answer`, `stale`.
- Never echoed into events: `title`, `path`, `step`, `concepts`, `pages`.
  The manifest is the single truth for those; adapters read them from the
  bundle at delivery time, keyed by `lesson_uid`, so events can't carry
  stale copies. Idempotent adapter delivery rides `events.uuid` (B4).

## 9. Versioning, compatibility, and reader outcomes

### 9.1 Version policy

- Readers dual-read `schema_version` 1 and 2.
- A missing `schema_version` on an otherwise readable manifest is read as
  v1 (flat-file-era compatibility).
- Any other version (non-integer — a JSON boolean is NOT an integer despite
  Python's `bool`/`int` subtyping — `< 1`, or `> 2`) ⇒ **visible reject**: the
  preview shows an explicit "unsupported manifest version" placeholder (same
  pattern as the missing-file placeholder), the lesson stays listed, and
  nothing is silently coerced to defaults.
- The read path NEVER rewrites a manifest on disk. Auto-creating a missing
  manifest for a fresh lesson is creation, not migration; upgrading v1 → v2
  happens only through the explicit migration tool (C4).

### 9.2 Reader outcomes and finding codes

Three outcomes: `ok` (render, possibly with informational findings),
`degraded` (render continues; specific items dropped or features disabled),
`rejected` (visible placeholder; no page render; attempt writes refused).
Readers MUST surface findings to the preview metadata — silently discarding
a finding is non-conforming.

Aggregation: a reader computes **all** applicable findings before
returning. Only `symlinked-bundle` (checked before the manifest is opened —
reading past it would follow the link §2 forbids), `manifest-unreadable`,
`manifest-too-large`, and `unsupported-version` short-circuit (there is
nothing meaningful to check past them); everything else —
`missing-identity` included — accumulates
across the whole manifest. The outcome is the most severe finding present
(`rejected` > `degraded` > `ok`; informational findings never change the
outcome). This is why one fixture can require several codes at once.

| finding              | outcome   | condition |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| `manifest-unreadable`| rejected  | file present but not valid JSON, or not a JSON object |
| `manifest-too-large` | rejected  | manifest > 256 KiB |
| `unsupported-version`| rejected  | §9.1 |
| `missing-identity`   | rejected  | v2 without `lesson_uid`, or `lesson_uid` not a UUID |
| `duplicate-id`       | rejected  | id repeated within pages/questions/blocks |
| `duplicate-path`     | rejected  | `pages[].path` repeated, or two blocks claim one file |
| `limit-exceeded`     | rejected  | a §4 **list-count** limit exceeded (pages/questions/blocks/concepts/artifact_roots); scalar over-limits degrade instead — see `stale-metadata`, `invalid-value` |
| `no-pages`           | rejected  | v2 with zero valid pages |
| `invalid-entry`      | degraded  | `entry` invalid or not in `pages[]`; fall back to first valid page |
| `invalid-path`       | degraded  | a page path, block `file`, or artifact root violates §4.1; the carrying item is dropped |
| `invalid-id`         | degraded  | a page/question/block `id` violates the §3 grammar; the item is dropped |
| `outside-root`       | degraded  | `blocks[].file` outside every artifact root; block dropped |
| `dangling-ref`       | degraded  | question/block references a `page_id` absent from the **post-drop valid page set** (a raw-declared but dropped page counts as missing); item dropped |
| `unknown-profile`    | degraded  | §5; forced `legacy-display` |
| `unknown-runner`     | degraded  | §4.4; Run disabled, editor stays |
| `unknown-kind`       | degraded  | §4.4; `blocks[].kind` not recognized; block dropped |
| `overlapping-roots`  | degraded  | §7; the nested root is dropped |
| `invalid-ref`        | degraded  | malformed `path`/`concepts` entry, or orphan/non-integer/out-of-range `step`; the ref/step is dropped |
| `identity-mismatch`  | degraded  | manifest `lesson_uid` ≠ DB `uid`; render as `legacy-display`, refuse attempt writes |
| `symlinked-bundle`   | rejected  | §2; the bundle directory itself, or `lesson.json` itself, is a symlink |
| `symlinked-path`     | degraded  | §2; a referenced path resolves through a symlink — treated as a missing file |
| `type-mismatch`      | degraded  | §4; a field's JSON type contradicts the schema (field treated as absent) or a list item is not an object (item dropped) |
| `invalid-value`      | info      | an optional display/value field (`pages[].title`, `label`, `kind`, `language`, `runner_id`, `updated_by_agent_at`) violates its grammar or limit; the field is dropped, the item stays |
| `missing-attempts-root` | info   | §7; `attempts` injected into the read model |
| `stale-metadata`     | info      | `slug`/`title`/`source_url` copy differs from DB or violates its own grammar/limit; DB wins |
| `duplicate-concept`  | info      | §4.5; deduped |

`manifest-unreadable` and `manifest-too-large` apply to v1 reads too — this
is the one deliberate v1 behavior change: a corrupt manifest becomes a
visible reject instead of silently rendering an empty default (#39's
"silent projection" complaint). A *missing* manifest keeps today's behavior
(a fresh default is created — creation, not repair).

The v1 read model is normative and equals today's `_normalise_manifest`
exactly — C3's dual-reader and C4's migration input are THIS, not the raw
strings and not v2 grammar applied retroactively:

- `entry` and each `related[]` item may be a string or an object whose
  `path` member is a string (the object form is unwrapped);
- each candidate is cleaned per `_clean_bundle_ref`: backslash, control
  characters, absolute paths, and `..` are rejected; `PurePosixPath`
  normalization collapses `./` prefixes, doubled slashes, and trailing
  slashes; `entry` must additionally end `.html`;
- an absent/non-string/invalid `entry` falls back to `index.html`; invalid
  `related[]` items are dropped; `related` is deduplicated in first-seen
  order and excludes the entry;
- unknown fields are ignored (and survive on disk — v1 files are never
  rewritten).

C3 readers SHOULD emit the matching findings (`invalid-entry`,
`invalid-path`, `duplicate-path`) for v1 instead of dropping silently;
behavior (what renders) is unchanged.

### 9.3 Unknown fields

Unknown fields — top-level or nested — are ignored by readers and preserved
**semantically** by every writer (agent, app, migration tool): structurally
identical values, original relative key order. Canonical output normalizes
representation (whitespace, string escapes, number spelling), so literal
byte preservation of a non-canonical input is not promised — parsing and
re-dumping cannot provide it. Additive evolution inside v2 means new
OPTIONAL fields; any change to the meaning of an existing field requires
v3.

Canonical serialization, exactly: Python's
`json.dumps(manifest, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2) + "\n"`, UTF-8 — the
existing `_write_manifest` idiom. Every nested object and array is expanded
across lines by `indent=2`; no compact one-line forms. Key order is
recursive: each object serializes its known keys first, in the order its
defining table/section lists them (top level: the §4 table; `pages[]`
items: `id`, `path`, `title`; `questions[]` items: `id`, `page`, `kind`,
`label`; `blocks[]` items: `id`, `page`, `kind`, `language`, `file`,
`runner_id`; `runtime`: `profile`), then unknown keys in their original
relative order. Absent optional fields are omitted, not written as `null`
(`source_url: null` is accepted on read as absent, v1 heritage).

Round-tripping a manifest **already in canonical form** through the
canonical writer MUST be byte-identical (unknown fields, page order, and
key order all preserved) — C4's hash-based post-verification depends on it,
and every C4/C3-written manifest is canonical by construction. A valid but
non-canonical input round-trips semantically; its first canonical rewrite
normalizes representation. The fixture manifests are stored in canonical
form, and C3's verify round-trips each accepted fixture and asserts
byte-identity so the definition can't drift.

## 10. v1 → v2 migration mapping (consumed by C4)

The migration's **structural** input is the normalized v1 read model of
§9.2 (what `_normalise_manifest` yields for `entry`/`related`), never the
raw strings. Unknown-field preservation and the collision stop-condition
below operate on the **raw parsed object** — normalization drops unknown
keys from the read model, so the tool must read both.

| v2 field | source |
|----------|--------|
| `schema_version` | `2` |
| `lesson_uid` | SQLite `lessons.uid` (minted/backfilled in C3; the tool never mints) |
| `slug`, `title`, `source_url` | copied from v1 (they already mirror the DB); a `null` `source_url` is omitted |
| `entry` | the normalized v1 `entry` |
| `pages` | `[entry, *related]` from the normalized read model, order preserved; additionally, a valid DB `current_entry` absent from that list is inserted at the head (today's display-injection position), `entry` unchanged; ids minted deterministically: `"pg_" + sha256(lesson_uid + "\n" + path)` first 16 hex — reproducible across dry-run/run/re-verification; NOT re-derived on later renames (§3.1); unknown members of a v1 **object-form** `entry`/`related[]` item are copied verbatim onto the page object generated for that path, after `id`/`path` (§9.3 order) |
| `questions`, `blocks`, `path`, `step`, `concepts` | absent (the agent adds them later per #35) |
| `runtime` | `{"profile": "legacy-display"}` |
| `artifact_roots` | `["attempts"]` |
| `updated_by_agent_at` | preserved; `null` is omitted (today's `_default_manifest` writes `null`); a malformed non-null value is preserved verbatim and the v2 reader treats it as absent (`invalid-value`) |
| unknown v1 fields | preserved (semantically, §9.3) |

Stop-before-write conditions — the tool fails visibly and leaves the
manifest untouched (consistent with C4's stop-on-unsafe posture):

- a normalized v1 page path still violates the v2 grammar or a §4 limit
  (e.g. over-long path, too many pages);
- an unknown v1 key collides with a v2-owned key (`lesson_uid`, `pages`,
  `questions`, `blocks`, `path`, `step`, `concepts`, `runtime`,
  `artifact_roots`) — there is no lossless place for both;
- an object-form `entry`/`related[]` item carries a member named `id`,
  `path`, or `title` beyond the consumed path — it would collide with the
  v2-owned page-object keys.

Invariants: HTML page bytes untouched; the DB `current_entry` selection
untouched; idempotent (a v2 input is a no-op); dry-run, atomic replacement,
rollback manifest, and hash post-verification are C4 tool requirements. The
fixture pair `v1-valid.json` → `v1-migrated.json` is the executable form of
this table (given the fixture's `lesson_uid`).

## 11. Fixtures

`fixtures/lesson-manifests/` — invented demo data (every file carries the
"Vera Example" marker required by `scripts/check_public_hygiene.py`; no real
lesson content). `cases.json` is the machine-readable expectation table:
each case names a fixture, the expected outcome, and finding codes that MUST
appear (others MAY). Consumers: C3 `verify.py` reader tests, C4 migration
tool tests.

| fixture | expectation |
|---------|-------------|
| `v1-valid.json` | v1 read, `ok` |
| `v1-migrated.json` | v2 read, `ok`; byte-equal to migrating `v1-valid.json` with the fixture's `lesson_uid` |
| `v2-valid.json` | v2 read, `ok` (full feature surface) |
| `v2-unknown-fields.json` | v2 read, `ok`; unknown fields preserved on round-trip |
| `v2-invalid-paths.json` | `degraded`: `invalid-entry`, `invalid-path`, `outside-root` |
| `v2-duplicate-refs.json` | `rejected`: `duplicate-id`, `duplicate-path` |
| `v2-missing-identity.json` | `rejected`: `missing-identity` |
| `v2-unknown-profile.json` | `degraded`: `unknown-profile` (forced `legacy-display`) |
| `v2-degraded-refs.json` | `degraded`: `dangling-ref`, `unknown-runner`, `invalid-ref` |
| `v2-unreadable.json.broken` | `rejected`: `manifest-unreadable` (`.broken` keeps it out of `*.json` globs) |
| `v99-unsupported-version.json` | `rejected`: `unsupported-version` |

Runner-dependent expectations are executable only against a registry:
`cases.json` carries a fixture-only `runner_registry` context
(`python-script-v1` known, `quantum-teleport-v9` unknown) that C3 tests
MUST install regardless of what the real F3 registry contains. The
migration case likewise carries its DB context (`lesson_uid`,
`db_current_entry`) machine-readably.

The projection record example lives inline in §6.2 (a committed
`attempts.jsonl` would trip the repo-wide `*.jsonl` hygiene denial — the
real file is runtime data and never enters Git). Codes and behaviors with
no fixture need runtime context and are synthesized in C3/C4 tests instead:
`manifest-too-large` (an oversized file), `identity-mismatch` and
`stale-metadata` (require a DB row to disagree with), `symlinked-path`
(needs a filesystem), migration rerun/idempotency, rename/edit id
stability, and current-entry head-insertion (§10).

## 12. Write authority

| surface | app | study agent | migration tool (C4) | learner |
|---------|-----|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| `schema_version` | at creation | — | v1→v2 only | — |
| `lesson_uid` | mints (SQLite) + echoes | — | copies from DB | — |
| `slug`, `title`, `source_url` | owns (DB + echo) | — | copies | — |
| `entry`, `pages`, `questions`, `blocks` | creation skeleton | ✎ mints ids per §3, keeps them stable | pages from `related[]` | — |
| `path`, `step`, `concepts` | — | ✎ may add, revise, remove (this is how the knowledge map accrues, #38) | — | — |
| `runtime.profile` | sets at creation/migration | ✎ may switch between **registered** profiles (e.g. upgrade a reworked legacy bundle); unknown values fail closed | sets `legacy-display` | — |
| `artifact_roots` | default | ✎ may append (≤ 8, must keep `attempts`) | default | — |
| `updated_by_agent_at` | — | ✎ sets on edits | preserved | — |
| lesson pages / `assets/` | creation placeholder | ✎ authors | byte-preserved | — |
| `attempts.jsonl` | owns (projection + reconcile) | read-only | — | read-only |
| `attempts/` files | editor save endpoint (F1) | read (SHOULD not edit learner work — #35) | — | ✎ via terminal/editor |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | regenerates (B1 writer) | overwritten | — | — |

The agent MUST NOT: change `lesson_uid` or `schema_version`, reuse retired
ids, write `attempts.jsonl`, or put commands into the manifest (§4.4).
Agent-caused violations degrade or reject visibly per §9.2 — the app never
silently rewrites an agent's manifest to "fix" it.
