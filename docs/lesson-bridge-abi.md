# Lesson bridge ABI (v1)

Status: frozen with D2. This is the contract between the Learn page's parent
runtime (`app/static/src/learn-bridge.ts`, emitted `learn-bridge.js`) and a
lesson page running inside the sandboxed preview iframe. The bundle contract
that decides *whether* a page may be bridged lives in
[learn-bundle-spec.md](learn-bundle-spec.md) (§5 profiles, §6.3 identity);
this document owns the wire shapes. D4/D5 extend the operation set; they do
not change the handshake.

ABI v1 deliberately carries **no write capability**: capability negotiation
always resolves to the empty set and the only port operation is `ping`. The
value of v1 is the membrane itself — versioning, identity ownership, and the
teardown rules — landing before any state-changing operation exists.

## 1. Trust model

- The lesson document is **untrusted content** in an opaque-origin sandbox
  (`sandbox allow-scripts`, CSP per §5). The parent runtime is trusted app
  code on the app origin.
- The **parent owns identity**: `lesson_uid`, `page_id`, `page_rev`, and the
  granted capability set all come from the parent, which reads them from the
  app's preview metadata (server-derived, spec §6.3). The child never
  supplies a route, slug, path, or id — a child claim about "which page I
  am" has no channel to travel on.
- The parent binds identity to the **loaded revision**: it arms a handshake
  only while the metadata's version token equals the token of the navigation
  it performed itself (D1 folds the effective profile into that token). A
  metadata read that disagrees triggers reload, never a grant.
- Messages **to** the child use `targetOrigin: "*"` — an opaque origin is
  not addressable by value. This is acceptable because (a) the parent posts
  only to the specific `contentWindow` it navigated, (b) the welcome payload
  contains page identity, no secrets, and (c) the actual channel is the
  transferred `MessagePort`: capability follows possession of the port, not
  the ability to observe a broadcast.
- Messages **from** the child are accepted only when
  `event.source === frame.contentWindow`, the parent is armed for the
  current document, and no grant has been consumed yet.

## 2. Handshake

The child initiates (the parent cannot know when the child's listener is
installed; a child that never asks is simply a display page):

```text
child → parent (window.parent.postMessage)
  { "ephemeris": "lesson-bridge", "type": "ready",
    "abi": [1],                  // supported ABI versions, 1–8 integers
    "want": ["attempts"] }       // optional capability wishes, ≤16 × ≤64 chars
```

Constraints: JSON text ≤ 4096 chars; `abi` entries are integers 1–999.
Malformed or oversized announcements are ignored (no reply — nothing to
negotiate with). The child SHOULD post to `window.parent` with targetOrigin
`new URL(location.href).origin` (its own document URL is the app origin even
though `window.origin` is `"null"` in the sandbox).

A child usually announces the moment its script runs — before the parent
has finished binding identity for the freshly loaded document (and, across
a parent-initiated reload, possibly before the parent processed the load).
Children MUST therefore re-announce `ready` periodically (every 250–500 ms
is fine) until they receive a `welcome` or `reject`, giving up after the
~2 s silence budget below. The parent answers announcements only on live
receipt while it is armed; earlier ones are deliberately dropped, never
buffered — an announcement held across the parent's async identity binding
could otherwise be answered into a successor document after a same-frame
navigation. In the common case a retry within the first half-second
completes the handshake. Duplicate announcements after a `welcome` are
ignored (one grant per document).

On a valid announcement whose `abi` contains a version the parent speaks
(v1: the literal `1`), the parent replies **once per loaded document**:

```text
parent → child (postMessage with one transferred MessagePort)
  { "ephemeris": "lesson-bridge", "type": "welcome",
    "abi": 1,                    // the selected version
    "lesson": { "lesson_uid": "…", "page_id": "pg_…",
                "page_rev": "sha256:…" },
    "capabilities": [] }         // granted set; v1 is always empty
```

The transferred port is the bridge. Everything after the welcome flows over
it; the parent's global `message` listener never answers the same document
twice (a second `ready` is ignored until the next navigation).

If no supported version overlaps:

```text
parent → child
  { "ephemeris": "lesson-bridge", "type": "reject",
    "reason": "abi-unsupported", "supported": [1] }
```

At most 3 rejects are answered per document; further announcements are
dropped silently.

If the page is not bridge-eligible (legacy profile, rejected manifest,
undeclared page, direct open outside /learn — §5), the child hears
**nothing**. Child pages MUST treat handshake silence (recommended: ~2s
timeout) as "no persistence available" and stay fully usable read-only.

## 3. Port protocol

Requests carry a child-chosen `request_id` (string, 1–128 chars); responses
echo it. Any message over 64 KiB of JSON text (the spec §6.2 line bound),
any non-JSON-serializable payload, and any message without a string `op` is
answered with an error and counted; after 8 protocol errors the parent
closes the port and the document stays unbridged until reloaded.

v1 operations:

```text
child → parent   { "op": "ping", "request_id": "r1" }
parent → child   { "op": "pong", "request_id": "r1", "abi": 1 }
```

Anything else: `{ "op": "error", "code": "unknown-op", "request_id": … }`.
Error codes are `malformed`, `oversized`, `unknown-op` (D4 adds the attempt
result codes). Unknown fields in any message are ignored, never an error —
that is the forward-compatibility room minor additions use.

## 4. Lifecycle and teardown

- **Navigation ends everything.** The port, the armed identity, and the
  one-grant flag die with the document (a `MessagePort` cannot outlive it).
  After every reload the child must announce `ready` again and gets fresh
  identity — `page_rev` may have changed.
- **Stale revision:** the parent polls the preview metadata (~1.2 s); a
  version-token change closes the port and reloads the frame with the
  server's current sandbox tokens applied first. Identity drift without a
  token change (a manifest-only edit moving `bridge_page` — corrected page
  id, revoked eligibility — while the file bytes and profile stay put)
  triggers the same reload. A grant can therefore outlive its identity by
  at most one poll interval; D4's server-side `page_rev` check is the
  authoritative stale-attempt handler (§6.4).
- **Self-navigation:** a load event the parent did not initiate is never
  bound or granted; the parent re-asserts the expected page (bounded — a
  document that fights the re-assert simply stays unbridged). This is the
  observer for the §5 "same-frame navigation" residual.

  Known residual within that residual: a document that navigates the frame
  BEFORE its own load event completes is indistinguishable from the
  parent's navigation completing — the frame is opaque-origin, load events
  carry no URL, and no other browser signal exists (same class as the spec
  §5 `navigate-to` gap). The successor document can then be bound and
  announce under the expected page's identity. This grants nothing the
  redirecting page did not already have: it is itself lesson content that
  could have completed the handshake and rendered arbitrary content under
  that identity, and `page_rev` still describes the manifest page's bytes
  on disk — which is what the attempt backend records against (§6.3).
  Post-load self-navigation IS detected and re-asserted.

  Related delivery residual: the iframe's `WindowProxy` survives
  navigation, so a `welcome` (or port message) already in flight when the
  frame self-navigates can be delivered to the successor document — the
  browser gives the sender no way to scope delivery to one document. The
  successor is the same trust domain (lesson content), ABI v1 carries no
  capability, and any capability-bearing extension (D4+) MUST re-validate
  identity server-side per operation instead of trusting port possession.
- **Profile flip:** the effective profile is folded into the version token,
  so a manifest-only flip reloads the document under the new CSP and sandbox
  tokens; the metadata never advertises a policy the displayed document was
  not served under.

## 5. Versioning

- `abi` is a single integer lockstep version. Additive, ignorable fields may
  ship within v1 (receivers ignore unknown fields); anything a v1 child
  could misinterpret bumps to 2.
- The parent speaks exactly one version per app build; the child announces
  the list it supports. There is no post-handshake renegotiation.
