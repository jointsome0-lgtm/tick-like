# Security review queue

Pending adversarial security reviews for the sensitive surfaces: the terminal
PTY/WS core (`app/terminal.py` + `app/static/terminal.js`), the future
`app/agent/`, and anything about to be exposed on a live port.

How it works:

- Whoever lands a change touching those surfaces appends one entry under
  **Pending** — date, commits, paths, one factual line about what changed.
  Entries stay neutral: facts only, no threat analysis.
- Draining an entry = applying `docs/reviews/review-prompt.md` (the standing
  brief) to it and writing a report next to this file. The brief is handed to
  the reviewer by file reference, never restated inline.
- Deploy gate: the live service does not restart with code whose entries are
  still Pending (AGENTS.md → Public-Safety Check).

Entry format: `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD — <commits> — <paths> — <what changed>`

- [x] 2026-07-16 — 5ae5017, eeb71f1 — `app/services/lessons.py`, `verify.py` —
  issue #35 stage 1: the generated lesson `AGENTS.md` brief (constant
  `_AGENTS_TEMPLATE`, regenerated on every lesson-terminal open) rewritten
  from bundle-layout mechanics into a teaching contract: tutor mission,
  per-section concept/visualization/prediction/reveal loop, self-check,
  no-fabricated-references rule, pinned-libraries-in-`assets/` rule (remote
  URLs disallowed), and the frozen v2 manifest names from
  `docs/learn-bundle-spec.md` (v1/v2 branches, `pg_`/`q_` id lifecycle,
  `questions[]`, `attempts.jsonl` read-only, agent must not change
  `schema_version`/`lesson_uid`); `_write_brief` and the `CLAUDE.md` shim
  unchanged; verify 379 (+3); drained on 5ae5017 →
  `2026-07-16-lesson-brief-teaching-contract-review.md` (one Medium, one
  Low — both fixed in eeb71f1, verify 380; addendum on the fix
  commit: L1/L2 resolved, no new findings)

- [x] 2026-07-16 — 61b6d65, 5d7c226, ad11d31 — `app/terminal.py`,
  `app/services/lessons.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/templates/learn.html`,
  `deploy/ephemeris.service.example`, `docs/security-model.md`, `README.md`,
  `verify.py`, `verify_restore.py` — issue #16 first slice: terminal websocket
  route and UI now register only when `EPHEMERIS_ENABLE_TERMINAL` is truthy
  (previous opt-out var no longer honored; systemd example ships it commented
  out with UMask/MemoryMax/TasksMax added); a `?lesson=` request whose
  workspace cannot be prepared — including a present-but-empty or junk slug —
  is refused with a visible message instead of spawning at the repo root; the
  child shell env is built from an allowlist plus `_detect_proxy_env` output
  instead of full `os.environ`; the proxy banner strips URL userinfo; Learn
  UI, preview-meta, and the missing-file preview placeholder expose a
  bundle-relative lesson path; verify wiring probes inverted, 368+28 green
  → `2026-07-16-terminal-optin-review.md` (drained on 61b6d65: two Low, one
  Info — T2/T3 fixed in 5d7c226, T1 accepted posture documented; addendum
  covers 5d7c226 + ad11d31: resolved, no new findings)

- [x] 2026-07-16 — a74eab1, e50090d — `app/security.py`, `app/main.py`,
  `verify.py`, `verify_restore.py`, `docs/security-model.md` — issue #15
  first slice: new ASGI middleware owns a trusted-host allowlist
  (`EPHEMERIS_TRUSTED_HOSTS`, loopback defaults), one origin policy for all
  unsafe methods (serialized http(s) origin == scheme+host+effective port,
  `null` rejected, absent Origin allowed only without cross-site fetch
  metadata), and global response headers (nosniff, Referrer-Policy, CSP
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` unless the route sets its own); the 28 per-route
  `_check_origin()` calls are removed; verify 361
  → `2026-07-16-write-guard-review.md` (one Low fixed in e50090d)

- [x] 2026-07-16 — 10a8a71 — `app/services/lessons.py`, `verify.py` —
  issue #14: generated lesson brief is now a constant (title/source URL no
  longer interpolated; the brief points the agent at `lesson.json` as data);
  `_write_brief` switched to same-directory 0600 tempfile + fsync + atomic
  `os.replace` (destination entry never opened); verify 345
  → `2026-07-16-brief-writer-review.md` (no findings)

- [x] 2026-07-16 — 9747fc9, a3683d7 — `app/static/terminal.js` —
  issue #37: tab-active pointer split into durable (`storedActiveId`, the only
  value persisted) and in-memory (`activeId`); off-Learn boot activates the
  first non-lesson tab in memory only; `connectAllTabs()` skips lesson tabs
  off-Learn (explicit switch still connects)
  → `2026-07-16-terminal-tab-scoping-review.md` (one Low fixed in a3683d7)

- [x] 2026-07-03 — multi-session terminal core — `app/terminal.py` —
  detach/reattach + fd lifecycle → `terminal-multisession-review.md`
  (F1–F4 fixed in 6f9538b)
- [x] 2026-07-06 — 2b2878f, 1fd1a63 — `app/terminal.py`,
  `app/templates/learn.html` — lesson-scoped terminal sessions →
  `learn-lesson-terminal-review.md` (one Low fixed in 1fd1a63)
- [x] 2026-07-07 — 92e585a — `app/services/lessons.py` —
  lesson workspace prep now also writes a `CLAUDE.md` brief shim (static
  `@AGENTS.md` include) via the same `O_NOFOLLOW` writer; +2 verify checks (338)
  → `2026-07-11-lesson-claude-shim-review.md`
- [x] 2026-07-11 — 4855e8e — `app/terminal.py`, `verify.py` —
  terminal websocket registration and local-only UI gating now honor
  `TICKLIKE_DISABLE_TERMINAL`; subprocess checks cover both switch states
  → `2026-07-11-terminal-disable-switch-review.md`
- [x] 2026-07-14 — d56b617 — `app/terminal.py`, `verify.py`, `verify_restore.py` —
  project rename: terminal controls renamed from `TICKLIKE_*` to `EPHEMERIS_*`
  → `2026-07-14-terminal-env-rename-review.md` (one Medium and two Low confirmed)
