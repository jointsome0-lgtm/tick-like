# Security review queue

Pending adversarial security reviews for the sensitive surfaces: the terminal
PTY/WS core (`app/terminal.py` + `app/static/terminal.js`), the future
`app/agent/`, and anything about to be exposed on a live port.

How it works:

- Whoever lands a change touching those surfaces appends one entry under
  **Pending** — date, commits, paths, one factual line about what changed.
  Entries stay neutral: facts only, no threat analysis.
- Draining an entry = applying `docs/reviews/review-prompt.md` (the standing
  brief) to it and writing a report next to this file. The brief is handed to
  the reviewer by file reference, never restated inline.
- Deploy gate: the live service does not restart with code whose entries are
  still Pending (AGENTS.md → Public-Safety Check).

Entry format: `- [ ] YYYY-MM-DD — <commits> — <paths> — <what changed>`

## Pending

- [ ] 2026-07-21 — 3931339, 4a019be, 165481c, 1467750, ef533d9, 43c4b1d, c357bc5 — the entry stays current with the branch: any
  further branch commit, and the merge commit itself once the PR lands, is
  appended here before any drain or restart (this repository merges via
  merge commits, never squash, so the landed tree is the reviewed branch
  head's tree and the listed branch commits are ancestors of the landed
  merge; ephemeral GitHub test-merge/squash preview hashes are not
  repository commits and are never tracked here) —
  `app/static/src/learn-bridge.ts` (+ emitted `app/static/learn-bridge.js`),
  `app/services/lessons.py`, `app/main.py`, `app/templates/learn.html`,
  `docs/lesson-bridge-abi.md`, `docs/lesson-attempts-api.md`, `verify.py` —
  issue #36 session D5: the bridge parent runtime now negotiates the
  `attempts` capability and implements the port `attempt` operation
  calling the D4 endpoint. The child supplies question_id/answer/
  request_id; the parent derives page identity from its armed binding,
  re-fetches preview metadata per operation and compares version, bridge
  identity, and the per-page declared-question list before the HTTP call;
  idempotency_key is the child's request_id; results and refusals are
  answered on the port (refusals reuse endpoint codes and do not count
  toward the protocol-error budget); a recorded attempt raises the app
  toast. preview-meta's `bridge_page` gains a `questions` array. Declared
  v2 pages are served from a one-descriptor snapshot (bytes, digest, and
  stat from the same open) with a content-bound version header; a new
  `PAGE_IDENTITY_MAX_BYTES` bound (4 MiB) excludes oversized pages from
  bridge identity with a visible finding while display falls back to the
  streaming response; the page digest cache evicts one entry when full
  instead of clearing. learn.html passes `data-attempts-url` to the
  runtime. The lesson-brief bridge bullet now states the frozen attempt
  call. ABI doc gains §3.1. verify.py adds a D5 section (592).
  4a019be (PR-bot round 1): the parent navigates the frame with
  `?v=<version token>` and the file route refuses snapshot bytes that no
  longer hash to it (409 + self-reload), from the server-rendered first
  navigation on; both one-descriptor readers enforce the size bound
  inside the read loop; attempt operations wait a 250 ms settle delay
  between validation and the HTTP call so a completing self-navigation
  tears down the port before the write leaves (stalled-load residual
  documented in ABI §3.1). verify 594.
  165481c (PR-bot round 2): the file route computes the identical
  mtime:profile[:digest16] token for every declared v2 page (legacy
  profiles included) and enforces the `?v` comparison on that surface
  even when no snapshot could be taken — the streaming fallback never
  serves bytes the requested token does not describe. verify 596.
  1467750 (PR-bot round 3): the size pre-check tolerates a page
  vanishing between is_file() and stat() — OSError falls through to
  the descriptor-bound hash open instead of a 500. verify 597.
  ef533d9 (PR-bot round 4): the pre-check is no-follow (lstat +
  S_ISREG) — a symlink raced in after the guard is never sized by
  target and falls through to the O_NOFOLLOW open. verify 598.
  43c4b1d (PR-bot round 5): each attempt call cleans up its own
  document's in-flight set (teardown replaces it), and the vanish
  probe stages the real deleted-file race against os.lstat.
  c357bc5 (PR-bot round 7): digest-cache eviction is race-
  tolerant (pop with default + iteration guard) — concurrent cache
  misses can no longer 500 a poll or page serve.

  the entry stays current with the branch: any further branch commit, and

  is appended here before any drain or restart — `app/db.py`, `app/services/attempts.py` (new),
  `app/services/bundle_schema.py` (round 8 only),
  `app/services/lessons.py`, `app/main.py`, `docs/lesson-attempts-api.md`
  (new), `verify.py` —
  issue #36 session D4: new write endpoint `POST
  /learn/lessons/{id}/attempts` (+ `by-slug` alias) recording learner
  attempts. Schema v12 adds the `lesson_attempts` table; each row is
  written in one transaction with a `lesson_attempt` ledger event. The
  handler validates submissions against the record-time bundle manifest
  (declared questions only; eligibility from the manifest read; staleness
  derived server-side from the current page binding and bytes), applies
  idempotency keys unique per lesson, per-lesson rate limiting, and body
  size caps, and synchronously appends a projection line to the bundle's
  `attempts.jsonl` (per-bundle lock; falls back to a full rebuild from
  SQLite). lessons.py gains two public read helpers (`read_bundle`,
  `hash_bundle_page`); no bridge/client code changed. The endpoint is
  behind the existing app-wide unsafe-method middleware. New contract doc
  describes request/response codes. verify.py adds a D4 section (565).
  4e7997f (PR-bot round 1): the idempotency replay lookup moved ahead of
  the record-time refusals, and the projection append loops on short
  write(2) counts; verify 567. 142ea74 (PR-bot round 2): refusals raised
  between the early replay check and the locked insert re-check the
  idempotency key under the bundle lock and return a committed duplicate;
  `created_at` carries microseconds and the projection fast path appends
  only when the file's tail sorts strictly before the new row by
  (created_at, attempt_id), otherwise rebuilding; verify 569. 6be555e
  (round 3): the projection fd's close(2) is guarded — a delayed write
  error counts as not-appended instead of raising past the durable
  write. 9da7758 (round 4): RecursionError from json.loads on a deeply
  nested body maps to the documented invalid-json 400. 89b4bc2 (round
  5, verify-only): the projection-outage check injects EIO by file name
  instead of chmod. ac08a7c (round 6): the projection fast path drops
  the count/tail heuristics and appends only when the file's bytes
  equal the §6.1 rebuild of every earlier authority row exactly (the
  appended line renders from the authority row). Round 7: attempt_number
  is counted inside the write transaction (a sibling process could
  inflate it post-commit); verify 572. Round 8: all nine identity/value
  grammar regexes in bundle_schema.py and attempts.py are \Z-anchored —
  Python's $ under .match() accepted a trailing newline, letting
  "pg_x\n"-style page/rev identities into the row and projection (and
  into manifest id validation); verify 573. Round 9: the idempotency
  replay lookup also precedes the rate limit — a retry of the
  window-exhausting attempt returns its duplicate, not a 429; replays
  and key conflicts consume no window budget; verify 574. Round 10:
  every projection section (snapshot, verify, append or rebuild) runs
  inside a BEGIN IMMEDIATE SQLite txn, serializing it cross-process
  against sibling commits and projection writes (a stale rebuild
  snapshot could otherwise overwrite a newer file); a directory
  planted at attempts.jsonl resolves as a deterministic collision
  (removed when empty, moved aside otherwise) instead of a permanent
  projection-pending state; verify 576. Round 11: the projection fast
  path additionally requires st_nlink == 1 (a planted hard link would
  leak the append into its other name; the rebuild replaces the name
  only), and the rate limit moved inside the refusal re-check block —
  a retry whose original committed after the early replay check gets
  its duplicate instead of a 429; verify 578. Round 12: rate-limit
  slots are charged per call but refunded on every replay/conflict
  outcome (they are not new writes; refusals of new writes stay
  charged), so retries racing a slow original cannot starve real
  attempts; the locked write section split into _record_locked;
  verify 579. Round 13 (docs/comment only): the per-process in-memory
  scope of the rate window is documented as the deployment contract
  (one worker; brief 2x during rolling-restart overlap; abuse damper,
  not a security boundary); no code change. Round 14 (docs-only): the
  commit list drops the self-referential round-commit placeholder for
  the standing append-before-drain/restart rule. Drained 2026-07-20 →
  `2026-07-20-attempt-backend-review.md` (Codex, standing brief by
  file reference, at head 83cc652): no Critical/High/Medium; two Low
  availability findings — A1 body cap enforced only after Starlette
  buffers the whole body (parser-framing dependent; issue #59),
  A2 projection append linear in lifetime history under the
  database-wide writer lock (issue #58) — both accepted as follow-ups,
  not blockers. Independent Opus second pass: no findings, concurs.
  Converged verdict: YES for the documented direct-loopback
  single-worker deployment; D5 capability-bearing bridge NO until the
  D2 report's L1 document-generation and L2 served-byte conditions are
  resolved (D4's per-operation server-side validation is retained and
  is the server half of that requirement); wider deployment NO

  (`_AGENTS_TEMPLATE`) gains a "Bridge conventions" section telling study
  agents how to wire interactive pages: Check actions via bridge port
  operations only, the ready/welcome handshake per
  `docs/lesson-bridge-abi.md` (retry cadence, ~2 s silence budget,
  handshake skipped on an opaque file-opened origin), parent-owned
  identity, `question_id` taken from the manifest's declared `questions[]`
  ids, and read-only degradation when no bridge or no `attempts`
  capability is present; states that the ABI v1 granted capability set is
  empty today and that pages scaffold to the conventions without inventing
  a write operation. Template text only — `_write_brief`, the `CLAUDE.md`

  the iframe `sandbox` attribute from the manifest's runtime profile, and
  implements the postMessage/MessageChannel handshake documented in
  `docs/lesson-bridge-abi.md` (versioned, one grant per loaded document,
  identity from the preview metadata; ABI v1 has no write operations —
  ping/pong only). The preview-meta endpoint additionally returns per-page
  `lesson_uid`/`page_id`/`page_rev` (sha256 of page bytes) and the sandbox

  first slice: new ASGI middleware owns a trusted-host allowlist
  (`EPHEMERIS_TRUSTED_HOSTS`, loopback defaults), one origin policy for all
  unsafe methods (serialized http(s) origin == scheme+host+effective port,
  `null` rejected, absent Origin allowed only without cross-site fetch
  metadata), and global response headers (nosniff, Referrer-Policy, CSP
  `frame-ancestors 'none'` unless the route sets its own); the 28 per-route
  `_check_origin()` calls are removed; verify 361

  issue #14: generated lesson brief is now a constant (title/source URL no
  longer interpolated; the brief points the agent at `lesson.json` as data);
  `_write_brief` switched to same-directory 0600 tempfile + fsync + atomic
  `os.replace` (destination entry never opened); verify 345

  issue #37: tab-active pointer split into durable (`storedActiveId`, the only
  value persisted) and in-memory (`activeId`); off-Learn boot activates the
  first non-lesson tab in memory only; `connectAllTabs()` skips lesson tabs
  off-Learn (explicit switch still connects)
