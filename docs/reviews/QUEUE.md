# Security review queue

Pending adversarial security reviews for the sensitive surfaces: the terminal
PTY/WS core (`app/terminal.py` + `app/static/terminal.js`), the future
`app/agent/`, and anything about to be exposed on a live port.

How it works:

- Whoever lands a change touching those surfaces appends one entry under
  **Pending** — date, commits, paths, one factual line about what changed.
  Entries stay neutral: facts only, no threat analysis.
- Draining an entry = applying `docs/reviews/review-prompt.md` (the standing
  brief) to it and writing a report next to this file. The brief is handed to
  the reviewer by file reference, never restated inline.
- Deploy gate: the live service does not restart with code whose entries are
  still Pending (AGENTS.md → Public-Safety Check).

## Pending

- [ ] 2026-07-23 — commits after `13cab1b` on
  `fix/58-attempts-projection-cost` — `app/services/attempts.py`, `app/db.py`,
  `verify.py`, `docs/lesson-attempts-api.md`, `docs/reviews/QUEUE.md` — issue
  #58 replaces the attempt projection's database-wide writer-lock section and
  full-prefix append verification with private lesson-UID file locking, a
  durable private cursor/seal, bounded-row fast append, streaming reconcile,
  schema-v13 cursor indexing, and growth/concurrency/race regressions. The
  first bot-findings round makes busy locks return projection-pending, refuses
  reconcile from active transactions, treats recursively malformed state as
  repair input, and compares the full post-append descriptor/name seal. It
  second round keeps the rendered temp descriptor open across rebuild
  publication and compares its stable render fields plus full published-name
  seal before advancing the cursor. The third round validates cursor-id and
  sort-tail authority anchors, binds append state to the immediate post-write
  descriptor plus a bounded tail read, detects mtime-restored rebuild
  rewrites, and never retries a failed close. It does not change attempt
  authority, HTTP responses, refusal ordering, rate-limit semantics, or the
  `attempts.jsonl` line format.

- [ ] 2026-07-23 — commits after `c125534` on
  `fix/59-attempt-body-stream-cap`; LANDED via merge commit `06e4674`, whose
  tree is byte-identical to reviewed branch head `9d9b8ee` — `app/main.py`,
  `verify.py`, `docs/reviews/QUEUE.md` — issue #59 changes both lesson-attempt
  aliases to enforce the existing 256 KiB request-body limit while consuming
  the ASGI stream, rejects negative declared lengths, and adds direct-ASGI
  admission regressions; it does not change in-cap attempt semantics,
  persistence, the projection format, or any listener configuration.

  `fix/35-f5-blocks-activation`; reviewed application head `418615f` —
  `app/services/lessons.py`, `verify.py`, `docs/reviews/QUEUE.md` — issue #35
  phase F activation replaces only the generated lesson brief's inactive
  editor/run-block section with active manifest, artifact-placement,
  registered-runner, bridge-operation, text-only-output,
  graceful-degradation, and teaching-purpose conventions, plus matching
  verifier anchors. The initial PR findings round preserves learner-artifact
  ownership, requires the interactive profile, and supplies the concrete
  editor/run ready request. `d2f97f4` (drain cycle 1) gates editor and Run
  independently and repeats the minimum frozen operation/revision/run-ownership
  rules; `c148e6b` (cycle 2) handles parent-relayed `run.error`; `a0e694f`
  (cycle 3) handles request-scoped errors and negotiates `attempts` only for
  declared answers; `418615f` (cycle 4) closes terminal `job-missing`,
  mutating-error revision resync, no-stdin runner guidance, and stale-report
  verdict handling. Verify 756, verify_restore 28. It changes no runtime code
  path, schema, ABI, sandbox, CSP, route, terminal surface, or other brief
  section. Drained 2026-07-23 →
  `2026-07-23-blocks-activation-review.md`: nine Low findings, all resolved in
  four cycles; no Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info, or open finding remains.
  Brief-writer, teaching/data-boundary, bridge, artifact, runner, run-API,
  frontend, lesson-role, and terminal protections retain the report's stated
  dispositions; F4's generated-pedagogy activation condition is resolved.
  Final verdict: SAFE TO MAKE LIVE for the documented direct-loopback
  single-worker deployment; wider, proxy-adjacent, or multi-user deployment
  NO. Live restart is owner-only and was not performed.

  phase F frontend slice adds the editor bridge membrane first and the run
  membrane in a later commit, plus their text-only child conventions fixture,
  additive ABI documentation, and regression coverage. The editor boundary's
  first Codex findings round aligns the client block bound with the
  manifest, repeats fresh block validation after the save-settle window, and
  refreshes block metadata before granting the editor; its second round
  preserves the attempt operation's 32 KiB semantic bound inside the wider
  editor membrane. The run boundary's first Codex findings round repeats
  fresh block validation after artifact reads, rejects backend-invalid
  idempotency keys before composite saves, and keeps owned-job cancellation
  available after block removal while retaining fresh page-identity checks.
  Its second Codex findings round drains complete SSE frames before bounding
  the retained partial frame and derives the backend idempotency key from the
  whole save/run operation before the save; generated-brief activation remains
  the separate following F5 slice. It does not change backend routes, attempt
  persistence, CSP, sandbox tokens, or terminal statics. Its third Codex
  findings round computes that key without secure-context-only Web Crypto so
  supported plain-HTTP trusted-LAN clients retain Run. Its fourth Codex
  findings round makes private artifact reads fail closed until a sticky
  per-document parent confirmation explicitly accepts the lesson page's
  same-frame navigation egress, and repeats fresh block/Run validation after
  start before exposing the returned job or output. `9e3956b` (drain cycle 1)

  late-cancel semantics, independent reader wakeups, and raced-exit draining.
  `f7e9aef` (drain cycle 1) gives each SSE attachment an idempotent response-

  parent runtime now negotiates the `attempts` capability and implements the
  port `attempt` operation calling the D4 endpoint. The child supplies
  question_id/answer/request_id; the parent derives page identity from its
  armed binding, re-fetches preview metadata per operation and compares
  version, bridge identity, and the per-page declared-question list before the
  HTTP call; idempotency_key is the child's request_id; results and refusals
  are answered on the port (refusals reuse endpoint codes and do not count
  toward the protocol-error budget); a recorded attempt raises the app toast.
  preview-meta's `bridge_page` gains a `questions` array. Declared v2 pages are
  served from a one-descriptor snapshot (bytes, digest, and stat from the same
  open) with a content-bound version header; a new `PAGE_IDENTITY_MAX_BYTES`
  bound (4 MiB) excludes oversized pages from bridge identity with a visible
  finding while display falls back to the streaming response; the page digest
  cache evicts one entry when full instead of clearing. learn.html passes
  `data-attempts-url` to the runtime. The lesson-brief bridge bullet now states
  the frozen attempt call. ABI doc gains §3.1. verify.py adds a D5 section
  (592). 4a019be (PR-bot round 1): the parent navigates the frame with
  `?v=<version token>` and the file route refuses snapshot bytes that no
  longer hash to it (409 + self-reload), from the server-rendered first
  navigation on; both one-descriptor readers enforce the size bound inside the
  read loop; attempt operations wait a 250 ms settle delay between validation
  and the HTTP call so a completing self-navigation tears down the port before
  the write leaves (stalled-load residual documented in ABI §3.1). verify 594.
  165481c (PR-bot round 2): the file route computes the identical
  mtime:profile[:digest16] token for every declared v2 page (legacy profiles
  included) and enforces the `?v` comparison on that surface even when no
  snapshot could be taken — the streaming fallback never serves bytes the
  requested token does not describe. verify 596. 1467750 (PR-bot round 3): the
  size pre-check tolerates a page vanishing between is_file() and stat() —
  OSError falls through to the descriptor-bound hash open instead of a 500.
  verify 597. ef533d9 (PR-bot round 4): the pre-check is no-follow (lstat +
  S_ISREG) — a symlink raced in after the guard is never sized by target and
  falls through to the O_NOFOLLOW open. verify 598. 43c4b1d (PR-bot round 5):
  each attempt call cleans up its own document's in-flight set (teardown
  replaces it), and the vanish probe stages the real deleted-file race against
  os.lstat. c357bc5 (PR-bot round 7): digest-cache eviction is race-tolerant

  handler validates submissions against the record-time bundle manifest
  (declared questions only; eligibility from the manifest read; staleness
  derived server-side from the current page binding and bytes), applies
  idempotency keys unique per lesson, per-lesson rate limiting, and body
  size caps, and synchronously appends a projection line to the bundle's
  `attempts.jsonl` (per-bundle lock; falls back to a full rebuild from
  SQLite). lessons.py gains two public read helpers (`read_bundle`,
  `hash_bundle_page`); no bridge/client code changed. The endpoint is
  behind the existing app-wide unsafe-method middleware. New contract doc
  describes request/response codes. verify.py adds a D4 section (565).

  appended line renders from the authority row). Round 7: attempt_number
  is counted inside the write transaction (a sibling process could
  inflate it post-commit); verify 572. Round 8: all nine identity/value
  grammar regexes in bundle_schema.py and attempts.py are \Z-anchored —
  Python's $ under .match() accepted a trailing newline, letting
  "pg_x\n"-style page/rev identities into the row and projection (and
  into manifest id validation); verify 573. Round 9: the idempotency
  replay lookup also precedes the rate limit — a retry of the
  window-exhausting attempt returns its duplicate, not a 429; replays
  and key conflicts consume no window budget; verify 574. Round 10:
  every projection section (snapshot, verify, append or rebuild) runs
  inside a BEGIN IMMEDIATE SQLite txn, serializing it cross-process
  against sibling commits and projection writes (a stale rebuild
  snapshot could otherwise overwrite a newer file); a directory
  planted at attempts.jsonl resolves as a deterministic collision
  (removed when empty, moved aside otherwise) instead of a permanent
  projection-pending state; verify 576. Round 11: the projection fast
  path additionally requires st_nlink == 1 (a planted hard link would
  leak the append into its other name; the rebuild replaces the name
  only), and the rate limit moved inside the refusal re-check block —
  a retry whose original committed after the early replay check gets
  its duplicate instead of a 429; verify 578. Round 12: rate-limit
  slots are charged per call but refunded on every replay/conflict
  outcome (they are not new writes; refusals of new writes stay
  charged), so retries racing a slow original cannot starve real
  attempts; the locked write section split into _record_locked;
  verify 579. Round 13 (docs/comment only): the per-process in-memory
  scope of the rate window is documented as the deployment contract
  (one worker; brief 2x during rolling-restart overlap; abuse damper,
  not a security boundary); no code change. Round 14 (docs-only): the
  commit list drops the self-referential round-commit placeholder for
  the standing append-before-drain/restart rule. Drained 2026-07-20 →

  handshake skipped on an opaque file-opened origin), parent-owned

  implements the postMessage/MessageChannel handshake documented in
  `docs/lesson-bridge-abi.md` (versioned, one grant per loaded document,

  ping/pong only). The preview-meta endpoint additionally returns per-page
